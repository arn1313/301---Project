/*Layout Rules
CSS, by its very nature, is used to lay elements out on the page.
However, there is a distinction between layouts dictating the major
and minor components of a page. The minor components—such as a callout,
or login form, or a navigation item—sit within the scope of major
components such as a header or footer. I refer to the minor components
as Modules and will dive into those in the next section. The major
components are referred to as Layout styles.
Layout styles can also be divided into major and minor styles based
on reuse. Major layout styles such as header and footer are traditionally
styled using ID selectors but take the time to think about the
elements that are common across all components of the page and use
class selectors where appropriate.*/
